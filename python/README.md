# Python Development Rules

This directory contains a comprehensive collection of modern Python development
guidelines, freshly updated with Anthropic's prompt engineering best practices.
Each rule file has been enhanced with practical examples, clear rationales, and
actionable guidance (with 100% less shouty imperatives!).

## Rule Files

### Core Guidelines

- [**General**](./python-general.mdc): Core interaction principles and communication
  patterns for effective AI assistance
- [**Development**](./python-development.mdc): Modern Python development using `uv`,
  with comprehensive examples and best practices

### Testing & Quality

- [**Testing**](./python-testing.mdc): Comprehensive testing strategies with pytest,
  fixtures, and practical examples
- [**Version Control**](./python-version-control.mdc): Git workflows with conventional
  commits and practical examples

### Build & Deployment

- [**GitHub Actions**](./python-github-actions.mdc): Complete CI/CD workflows with
  security best practices and `uv` integration
- [**Packaging Modernization**](./python-packaging-modernization.mdc): Modern
  `pyproject.toml` configuration with migration guides

### Documentation & Management

- [**Markdown Documentation**](./python-markdown-documentation.mdc): Documentation
  best practices with validation examples
- [**Version Management**](./python-version-management.mdc): Dependency management
  with `uv` and security scanning

## What Makes These Rules Special

Each rule file includes:

- **Clear rationales** explaining why guidelines matter
- **Practical examples** showing good vs. problematic patterns
- **Complete workflows** from development to deployment
- **Security considerations** and modern tooling
- **AI collaboration guidance** for effective pair programming
- **Conversational tone** that's helpful rather than demanding

These aren't just rulesâ€”they're your friendly neighborhood guidelines for building
better Python projects with modern tooling and best practices.
